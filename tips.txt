Always enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce credential-based attack risks.
• Avoid interacting with unknown or unsolicited URLs or attachments, especially from unverified senders.
• Use long, unique, and randomly generated passwords; never reuse credentials across services.
• Keep operating systems, browsers, firmware, and security tools updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
• Use a trusted VPN on public or unsecured Wi-Fi to protect network traffic from interception.
• Regularly review account login activity and access logs for suspicious behavior.
• Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to maintain confidentiality and integrity.
• Disable unused ports, services, and protocols to reduce your attack surface.
• Follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP) when granting user or system permissions.
• Routinely back up critical data using versioned, offline, or immutable backups.
• Verify URLs for Punycode or homoglyph spoofing before entering credentials.
• Use password managers to securely store and generate credentials.
• Monitor devices for unusual CPU, network, or disk activity that may indicate compromise.
• Harden browsers by disabling unnecessary extensions and enabling tracking protection.
• Enable DNS filtering or secure DNS (DoH/DoT) to prevent malicious domain resolution.
• Perform periodic vulnerability scans on your systems using reputable tools.
• Avoid using default credentials on any device or service—change them immediately.
• Log out of web sessions on shared or public devices to prevent session hijacking.
• Be cautious of QR codes from unknown sources—they can redirect to malicious URLs.
• Segment your home or lab network to isolate critical systems or testing environments.
